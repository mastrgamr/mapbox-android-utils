# Mapbox Android SDK Utility Library (Unofficial)
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/mastrgamr/mapbox-android-utils.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#mastrgamr/mapbox-android-utils)

Utility library for the Mapbox Android SDK. Inspired by [Google Maps Utility library](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-maps-utils)
Consider this the "pre-alpha" release. Google maps SDK and Mapbox have slight differences, so mapping the source is a Work in Progress.
Please submit issues and suggestions to the repo's [issues](https://github.com/mastrgamr/mapbox-android-utils/issues) tab.
